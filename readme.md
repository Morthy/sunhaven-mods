# Sun Haven mods

These are all mods I have created for Sun Haven. Some are publicly available on Nexus Mods, some are just for myself, friends or testing.

## Code info

I have no professional experience in C# and never really used before getting started modding Sun Haven.
Please don't use my code as an example of clean, good, or quality programming. It's purely here as reference.

Pull requests are welcome :)

## Support

If you need help, feel free to post on the Nexus mods discussion/issue tracker for the mod page.

Alternatively for prompter help (or if you feel like you might need to send your safe file), feel free to join my discord:

This is a multi purpose discord, please use #sunhaven-mods for anything related to modding!
