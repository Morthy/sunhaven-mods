## Something isn't working, what can I do?

Sun Haven doesn't officially support modding, so mod authors have to hook into the source code for Sun Haven manually. This often requires a lot of trial and error. Sun Haven is a complicated game with a complicated code base, so it's often easy for a mod to work for one person but not for another due to a varierty of reasons such as:

* Other mods installed
* Differences in save game file
* Differences in game version
* Using a different game language
* Any other kinds of black magic

Mod authors *do* want their mods to work for everyone, but we have no easy way to make a mod work without help from you.

To make sure it's not a conflict with another mod, please try temporarily removing all of your other mods to see if it fixes the issue you are having.

Here's how to report an issue:

1. Run the game until you encounter the issue you're having. If a mod just doesn't seem to be working, run the game until you get to the point where you expect something to have happened.
2. Go into your BepInEx folder and make a copy of the `LogOutput` file. This gets wiped every time you run the game, so it's important you make a copy to preserve its contents.
3. When reporting the issue, e.g. in Discord, upload the copy of this LogOutput file with your question.
4. Prepare as much information as possible about the problem. As an example, you could provide the answers to the following questions:

* What exact steps did you take before noticing the issue? (how can the mod author repeat what you did, step by step, to test it)
* What did you expect to happen vs what happened?
* What language are you playing the game in?
* What character type, year, and season are you in?

5. Optionally also post a copy of your game save file so the mod author can test in the same environment as you.
6. Please be polite and patient. Mod authors spend a lot of their spare time working on mods and are not paid to do so.

For any mod, you can usually ask for support in the Official Sun Haven discord modding channel: https://discord.gg/sunhaven

For my (Morthy) mods, you can also ask for support in my Discord: https://discord.gg/NCdDfYPPyy

If you don't want to use Discord, you can post a bug report on NexusMods, but it may take a long to resolve an issue because it's harder to gather all the required information.
